The 'Rabbit' is a wheeled robot built in collaboration with my four year
daughter Charlotte in 2023. The drive wheels were scavenged from an old 2008
Roomba. We use an old Raspberry Pi 2 Model B board with a camera module. The
rest of the peipherals will be added-on adhoc as we progress along.

One of her favorite toy was a rabbit shaped cleaning towel designed to be used
by kids. Hence the adoption of that name to be used on this robotic project.
